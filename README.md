# cineligne
Based on gablaxian/super-js-adventure and kittykatattack/ga , cineligne will use opal/opal-browser for the implementation, and opal complete rewrite.

The idea is to create an engine and a player . The player will be able to connect to a rails backend that will drive authentication, chat messages, files and challenge.

42s.video is a social network that try to reinvent the client <-> provider relationship , that should be based more on connections than on quote / invoice and PRs ... :)
