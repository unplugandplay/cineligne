# CINELIGNES

### What is a cineligne ?
A cineligne is the mythical connection between 2 people. As of today science doesn't have any device to show and then has choosen to study it using  mental analysis like with psychology and sociology. 
Then artistically speaking I will consider the connection as a beam made of untangible light-like component. 
My dad used to refer to a cineligne as rays of lights dancing in the real world. That is why I decided to use the term cineligne he invented decades ago, and applyed it to any yet to discovered untangible light form.

### Purpose

Based on an opal  ( plus  opal/opal-browser ) complete rewrite of gablaxian/super-js-adventure (for the editor) , kittykatattack/ga (for a sustainable engine) ,  inspired by mozilla/BrowserQuest and iliabylich/opal-browserquest-bot .

The idea is to create an editor, an engine and a (web|app)player . The player (front) will be able to connect to a rails backend (engine) that will drive authentication, chat messages, files and challenges.

42s.video is a social network that try to reinvent the client <-> provider relationship , that should be based more on connections than on contacts details, quotes / invoices,  and PRs' todo-lists ... :) 

Let's imagine slack with a board game ambiance ...
