# CINELIGNES

### What is a cineligne ?
A cineligne is the mythical connection between 2 peoples, as of today science doesn't have any device to show and then study it rather by mental analysis like psychology and sociology. Then artistically speaking I will consider it as made of untangible light like component. My dad used to refer to cineligne as rays of lights dancing in the real world. That is why I decided to use the term cineligne he invented, and applyed it to any yet to discovered untangible light form.

### Purpose

Based on gablaxian/super-js-adventure and kittykatattack/ga , cineligne will use opal/opal-browser for the implementation, and opal complete rewrite.

The idea is to create an editor, an engine and a player . The player (front) will be able to connect to a rails backend (engine) that will drive authentication, chat messages, files and challenge.

42s.video is a social network that try to reinvent the client <-> provider relationship , that should be based more on connections than on contacts details, quotes / invoices,  and PRs' todo-lists ... :) 

Let's imagine slack with a board game ambiance ...
